# Programming of data structures and fundamental algorithms (TC1031)
- All programs and files were created, compiled and run replit.com
- The "Sesion" folders contain code made in class (mostly finished).
- The "Actividades" folder contain our homework (finished).
- The "Portafolio_Final" contains the homework at the end of a module.
## Repository of the class "fundamental algorithms and data structures"
## First week
- Vectors, how to implement.
- Iterative and recursive functions.
- Complexity analysis of iterative and recursive functions.
## Second week, Search and sort algorithms
### Search algorithms
- Sequential search with an ordered and unordened vector.
- Iterative and recursive Binary search.
### Sorting algorithms
- SwapSort.
- SelectionSort.
- BubbleSort.
- InsertionSort.
- MergeSort.
- QuickSort.
## Third week, binary search trees (BST) singly and doubly linked list and its derivades
### Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List, methods to add, delete, get, update, find data and print the list.
- Doubly Linked List, same methods, but we are able to simplify a few methods thanks to the prev pointer.
### Stacks and Queues
- Stacks (Last in, first out) using singly linked lists.
- Queues (First in, first out) using singly linked lists.
### Binary Search Trees (BST) using Queues
- Insert, search and delete nodes.
- BST traversal (inorder, postorder, preorder and level by level).
## Fourth week, AVL trees using queue and heap trees
### AVL trees (Autobalancing)
- Insert, search and remove nodes.
- Traversal in inorder, postorder, preorder and level by level.
- Print of the three.
### Priority queues (Max heap)
- push (insert), top (get the root) and pop (delete root, it balances itself).
- getCapacity, getCurrentSize (number of elements), isEmpty and print the list.
